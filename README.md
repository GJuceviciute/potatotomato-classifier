# potatotomato-classifier
It's a basic classifier trained with? resnet 18 on pictures obtained using Bing Search API. It was inspired by and heavily based on fastai lessons (available here: https://course.fast.ai) and book "Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD" which you can buy or read as interactive Jupyter Notebooks for free.

In order to "play" with the potato-tomato classifier, you can:
  a) use the notebook (you will have to download the export.pkl file and then uncomment the commented lines and run it all)
  b) deploy and use it as an app (for free) using Binder
    1. go to https://mybinder.org
    2. write GJuceviciute/potatotomato-classifier as **GitHub repository name or URL**
    3. choose **URL** under **Path to a notebook file** and write /voila/render/Potato_tomato_classifier.ipynb
    4. Press *launch* and wait
    5. Follow the instructions there, i.e., upload a picture, and wait for the *magic* - prediction results
